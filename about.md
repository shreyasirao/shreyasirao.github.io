A romantic nerd, in search for the ultimate dream. A noob fired from within to make it to experts lane. Welcome to my site! It is a documentation of everything technical and all that interests me.  
My interests lie in Competitive coding, AI(and it's extended family), theoretical computer science, physics, philosophy, filmmaking and photography.
