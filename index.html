title: About me
---

A romantic nerd, in search for the ultimate dream. A noob fired from within to keep up with everything that interests her. And what does interest her? glad you asked. Competitive coding, AI(and it's extended family), theoretical computer science, physics, philosophy, filmmaking and photography.  Welcome to my site! It is a documentation of everything technical and is "gibberish simplified" as I like to call it. Feel free to write to me at shreyasirao97@gmail.com :)
